ANALYTICAL MANDATE
1. Competitive Intelligence Mapping

Construct a comprehensive competitive matrix with 3-5 direct competitors and 2-3 emerging disruptors
For each entity, synthesize:

Strategic positioning and unique value proposition
Pricing structure with specific figures and packaging approaches
Go-to-market strategy and channel effectiveness
Recent strategic initiatives and their observed market impact
Relative strengths/weaknesses using quantifiable metrics where possible



2. Opportunity Gap Analysis

Execute a systematic differential analysis between {{COMPANY}}'s current execution and competitive best practices
Identify and validate a minimum of 5 high-leverage opportunity vectors across:

Pricing optimization and packaging architecture
Customer acquisition channel diversification and efficiency
Retention and engagement loop reinforcement
Monetization depth and expansion mechanisms
Product differentiation and competitive moat building
Operating model efficiencies and margin enhancement opportunities



3. Strategic Prioritization Framework

Evaluate each identified opportunity using a rigorous scoring methodology:

Impact Potential (1-5): Revenue uplift, margin expansion, or competitive advantage creation
Implementation Feasibility (1-5): Resource requirements, technical complexity, organizational readiness
Time-to-Value (1-5): Speed of initial returns and payback period
Strategic Alignment (1-5): Consistency with core capabilities and long-term vision


Recommend the 3 highest-scoring initiatives based on weighted composite score
For each priority initiative, outline:

Precise scope definition and success metrics
Critical dependencies and risk mitigation approaches
Resource requirements and capability gaps
Implementation roadmap with concrete first steps



INTELLIGENCE GATHERING PROTOCOL
Apply institutional-grade research discipline:

Conduct exhaustive primary source analysis ({{COMPANY}} assets, competitor materials, industry reports)
Execute systematic secondary research spanning 150+ high-value sources
Triangulate findings across multiple information streams to ensure validity
Prioritize data recency and source credibility in all assessments
Document methodology limitations and confidence levels transparently
