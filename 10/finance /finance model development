As a senior financial analyst with expertise in [specific industry/sector], develop a comprehensive financial model framework for [specific business scenario: startup valuation, acquisition analysis, project feasibility, etc.].

Your financial model framework should include:

1. Model Structure and Design
   - Key modules and their interconnections
   - Critical inputs and assumptions (operational, market, and financial)
   - Time horizon and periodicity (monthly/quarterly/annual with rationale)
   - Clear distinction between historical data, assumptions, and calculated outputs

2. Core Financial Statements
   - Income statement projections with key line items and growth assumptions
   - Balance sheet structure with working capital mechanics
   - Cash flow statement with detailed cash flow drivers
   - Specific treatments for [industry-specific considerations]

3. Valuation/Analysis Methodology
   - Primary valuation approach(es) with justification (DCF, multiples, etc.)
   - Key metrics to be calculated (IRR, NPV, MOIC, payback period, etc.)
   - Sensitivity/scenario analysis framework for key variables
   - Benchmarking approach against industry comparables

4. Risk Assessment
   - 3-5 critical risk factors with quantifiable impact ranges
   - Stress testing methodology for adverse scenarios
   - Break-even analysis for key performance indicators

5. Dashboard Design
   - Essential KPIs to be highlighted
   - Visualization recommendations for complex data relationships
   - Executive summary structure for decision-makers

Ensure the model adheres to financial modeling best practices including separation of inputs/calculations/outputs, consistent formatting, and appropriate level of granularity. The model should balance comprehensiveness with usability, allowing for adaptation to changing assumptions while maintaining analytical integrity.
