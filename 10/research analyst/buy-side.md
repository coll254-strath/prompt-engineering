 RESEARCH REPORT REQUEST

 1. CONTEXT (My Background and Goal):
- Expert(s) conducting the research: `[Buy-side equity research analyst with experience in sector-specific valuation (e.g., energy, tech, financials), sovereign risk analysis expert, and a CFA charterholder with experience in credit and equity due diligence]`
- I am researching: `[A specific publicly traded company or asset class, e.g., "emerging market telecom company," "U.S. mid-cap renewable energy firm," "LatAm fintech player"]`
- My purpose is to: `[Perform institutional-grade investment due diligence to support a potential equity position or bond issuance. This may feed into an investment committee pitch or internal memo.]`
- I already know (briefly): `[Basic financial ratios, Moody’s and S&P credit methodologies, macro risk factors affecting the country, general understanding of the industry’s performance over the last few years]`
- Potential Gaps in Existing Research: `[Inconsistent forward guidance, unclear country-level risks, recent capital structure changes not reflected in public equity research, lack of recent SWOT and PESTEL evaluations]`
- Actionability of Findings: `[The results should enable a Buy/Hold/Sell recommendation or support a position sizing decision within a portfolio, aligned with internal investment policy and risk appetite]`

 2. CORE RESEARCH QUESTION & HYPOTHESIS:
- Primary Question: `[Is this security (e.g., company stock or corporate bond) undervalued or overvalued relative to its industry peers and sovereign risk exposure, based on a full-spectrum financial, operational, and geopolitical analysis?]`
- Hypothesis or Expected Insights: `[Despite recent volatility, the firm maintains strong cash flow visibility and competitive positioning that justifies a premium valuation within its sector — provided sovereign risk remains contained.]`
- Counterfactuals & Alternative Perspectives: `[What happens to valuation if bond yields rise further? Could FX depreciation or new regulatory risk reverse the investment thesis? Is the company actually a value trap masked by accounting profits?]`

 3. SPECIFICATIONS & PARAMETERS:
- Time Period: `[Last 5 fiscal years for trend analysis, latest quarterly data for recent shifts]`
- Geographic Location: `[Specify company HQ and primary operating jurisdictions — also evaluate sovereign risk and macro profile of these countries]`
- Industry/Sector Focus: `[Specify exact industry or sub-sector, e.g., "Latin American consumer banking," "global shipping and logistics," "SaaS B2B enterprise tech"]`
- Demographic Focus: `[Not directly relevant unless the company’s revenues are driven by specific consumer segments]`
- Methodological Approach: `[Fundamental bottom-up equity research integrated with top-down sovereign and sector-level macro analysis]`
- Ethical Considerations: `[Avoid bias from recent company news or selective comparisons; ensure analysis includes disclosure on potential data gaps]`
